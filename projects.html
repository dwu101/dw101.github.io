    <h1 style = "width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; font-weight: 90;display:flex;"><br>
      I gained the idea for this project during my internship at the Bioengineering lab. I noticed
      that after they had scanned and taken pictures of surgically broken bones, they would
      have someone look at the pictures and decide whether or not the sample was good
      enough to keep or throw it away. The main thing that was looked for was bone alignment.
      Since I don't want to show real samples from the lab, I create a very realistic remake.
      Picture (1) shows an aligned broken bone, while picture (2) shows a very unaligned broken
      bone. <br><br>
      This project determines the angle at which a bone is broken to provide the groundwork
      for determining an exact angle of breakage that would cause a sample to be thrown away.
      Taking inspiration from popular algorithms for image analysis, I developed my own edge detection algorithm to find the edge of the bone. The green in picture (3) shows the edge
      my algorithm found as well as the angle of breakage that it calculated, which is 11.11
      degrees.</h1>

        I have no idea where the inspiration for this came from -- it was just something I thought
        would be cool to code up and uses a lot of concepts that I am interested in. The goal is to
        use a Tensorflow neural network to be able to determine the shape and size of an 3D
        object purely based on how the area of the object's shadow changes as it rotates.<br><br>
        I generated my own data set for this. To do so, I implemented Python code that displays
        the 2D projection of a 3D object onto the computer screen and utilizes rotation matrices
        (a concept of Linear Algebra) that rotates this projection. These displays are essentially
        shadows of the object, assuming that a light is shined perfectly flush with the object. I take
        screenshots, then analyze the screenshot to determine the total number of pixels that are
        within the edges of the shape (aka the area of the shadow). Examples of screenshots can
        be seen in pictures (4) and (5).<br><br>
        Each line of data that is put into the neural network is an array of all the areas calculated,
        as well as the edge length. Currently, there are very few data points because the data set
        takes a long time to execute (took 3 hours for 34 data points... yikes). I am working
        continuously to optimize my algorithms, grow my data set, and increase the robustness of
        my neural network.</h1>
