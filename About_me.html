<div style ="position: absolute; left:45%; top:5%; color: white;font-size: 85px;">About me </div>

<div style = "position: absolute; top:20%; left: 20%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px">
No, I have never watched a James Bond movie. I'm more of a TV show guy anyway. Nonetheless, my name is Daniel Wu, and 
I am a student studying Computer Science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering
</div>

<div style = "position: absolute ; top:50%; left: 60%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px">
Actually, I'm not technically a CS major yet because I can't switch majors until the end of the semester. If NYU's database
 could talk and tell only truth, then it would say that I am a Biomolecular Science major. So you might be asking, why the change in major?
  </div>

<div style = "position: absolute; top:90%; left: 20%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;">Glad you asked. You might want to 
get some popcorn first. </div>

<div class = "scroll" style = "position: absolute; top:90%; left: 65%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;">
    
    <img id = "image" src = ""/>
  </div>

  <button type="button" onclick = "show()" id = "btnID" style = "position: absolute; top: 103%; left: -30%; width: 300px;">Click for Popcorn </button>

  <script> 
  function show(){
    let image = document.getElementById("image");
    image.src = "https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/popcorn-png/popcorn-concessions-zephyrhills-cinema-movie-theatre-13.png" 
    document.getElementById("btnID").style.display = "none";
  }
  </script>

<div style = "position: absolute; top:110%; left: 20%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;">I used to want to be a doctor. 
I volunteered at hospitals, partook in a selective Biomedical Sciences Academy throughout high school where I took multiple classes in Anatomy, Research, etc.
through Rutgers University.
</div>

<div style = "position: absolute; top:140%; left: 60%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;">But in senior year, I didn't want to be 
  pre-med, and I sure as heck did not want to go to medical school. Why did this happen? I'm not exactly sure but I am sure of what I felt.
  </div>
  
<div style = "position: absolute; top:170%; left: 20%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;"> So, I decided to give research a try and joined 
Alesha Castillo's lab at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing at the beginning of freshman year of college. I really enjoyed not only the wet lab work, but also the people, making my experience extremelly positive.
Towards the end of the year, I interned at Dr. Castillo's lab through the NYU Tandon Undergraduate Summer Research Program. 
</div>

<div style = "position: absolute; top:215%; left: 60%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;">Whoo! There's nothin' like summer in the city!
  Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty! Not exactly. Going into the lab everyday became difficult, as I lost interest in doing wet lab work. What now?
  </div>

<div style = "position: absolute; top:250%; left: 20%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;"> A lot of my friends were computer science majors, 
    so the topic has been in the back of my mind for a while. I enjoyed the singular Python course I took and have always enjoyed math, having already taken Calc 3, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations at this point.
    Why not give it a shot? Maybe it's for me.
</div>

<div style = "position: absolute; top:290%; left: 60%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;"> I noticed a part of the procedure the lab followed that required 
  a human to decide whether a sample was good enough to keep. But "good enough" is a grey area and is completely subjective. In a field that completely determines the science of the future, subjectivity is the 2nd worst enemy
  (1st being a lack of funding). So, I asked Dr. Castillo if I could work on an algorithm that could make this subjective process objective.
</div>
    
<div style = "position: absolute; top:335%; left: 20%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;"> I found this project extremely excited, spending hours coding up a preliminary algorithm and learning libraries, methods, 
  and functions I have never heard of before. I would work at the lab, and I would work on it when I got home. Though for work-life balance, I eventually worked on it only when I was at the lab. With this,
  I was excited getting out of bed, only needing one alarm to fully wake up instead of a couple. (This project can be seen in the Projects Tab, along with my other projects.)
</div>

<div style = "position: absolute; top:385%; left: 60%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 600px; height:300px;"> I knew I wanted to be a CS major, but there's a small issue. If I am swtiching to CS, I will be 2 semesters behind my peers as the CS class
  I took is not counted in the CS major's curriculum. So, I used online resources and my friends to help me self-study the first 2 intro CS classes. I adjusted very quickly to balancing studying, working, and more studying with having fun/exploring the city. Ultimately, I was able to test-out of the first intro course. 
  There does not exist an option to test out of the 2nd, but the course is easier because of my self-study. I am currently self-studying the 3rd intro course and learning as much as I can.
</div>

<div style = "position: absolute; top:445%; left: 20%; color: white;font-size: 30px; width: 1500px; height:300px;"> So... yea... that's basically it for now. Interested? Check out the side bar for more info!
