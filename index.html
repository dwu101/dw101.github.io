        <div class = "about_me_text">
            I used to want to do Biomedical Engineering research. However, upon starting an
            internship at a bioengineering lab at NYU Rory Meyers, I found that I was very disinterested
            in that field. After lots of debate, advice from friends and family, and numerous breakdowns,
            I decided to try CS.
            <br/><br/>
            I built a prototype of an algorithm that could be used to improve the lab's data quality,
            which I presented to my advisor along with my thoughts about switching interests. Luckily,
            my advisor was extremely supportive and allowed me to transition from a wet-lab-based
            internship to a tech-based internship while occasionally helping out around the lab.<br/><br/>
            Currently, I have experience with Python, Data Structures & Algorithms, Tensorflow, HTML,
            CSS, Flask, and React. I also have a deep-rooted interest in mathematics, having taken
            classes such as Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, Data Analysis, and Calculus 3.
            This semester, I am taking classes such as Object Orientated Programming (C++) and
            Finance.
