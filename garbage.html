    <div class = "about_me_text">
        Upon starting an
        internship at a bioengineering lab at NYU Rory Meyers, I found that even
        though I was interested in the topic, I was very disinterested in wet-lab work. 
        I had taken a couple CS cources up until that point and found it pretty interesting
        and after lots of debate, advice from friends and family, and numerous breakdowns,
        I decided to test my interest.
        <br/><br/>
        I built a prototype of an algorithm that could be used to improve the lab's data quality,
        which I presented to my advisor along with my thoughts about switching interests. Luckily,
        my advisor was extremely supportive and allowed me to transition from a wet-lab-based
        internship to a tech-based internship, which allowed me to find my passion for CS.<br/><br/>

        Currently, I am working for multiple projects in Professor Graham Dove's lab to ensure that the destruction of Manahattan Chinatown's Jail 
        and subsequent construction of the mega-jail remain within healthy and legal limits of pollution, noise, and vibration.
        This work is especially important because within 100ft of the site, there is a low-income senior citizen home 
        along with a daycare. Sensors that measure air quality, noise levels, and vibration levels were placed on site, and I wrote an 
        algorithm with Python and Google API to autonomously collect, store, and organize data. This algorithm is hosted on a Google Cloud Compute Engine
        Virtual Machine. 
        <br/><br/>
        
        Another project I am working on for Professor Graham Dove is the development of a mobile app that is used for 
        remote health monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Patients would have a sensor on their body that collects movement data
        at all times, which is then analyzed by the mobile app. Surveys will also be sent to the patient through the mobile 
        app periodically in order to help contextualize the data. Depending on the severity of the situation, the mobile app can respond accordingly,
        such as connecting the patient to their clinician or calling for emergency help. For this project, we have a React Native frontend with a 
        Flask backend and is tested with Expo Go and ngrok.

        <br/><br/>
        I also have a deep-rooted interest in mathematics, having taken
        classes such as Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, Data Analysis, and Calculus 3.
        This semester, I am taking courses in Computer Architecture and Organization, Computer Networking, Databases, and ML in Finance.
